## Persistent Plugin Storage

Plugins now have two storage tiers that survive container restarts and updates:

### Docker Volume (`/data`)

Every plugin gets a named Docker volume mounted at `/data` inside its container. Use this for databases, caches, or any file-based storage. The `NEXUS_DATA_DIR` environment variable points to this path.

### Key-Value Storage API

A lightweight REST API for small structured data:

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/api/v1/storage` | List all keys |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/storage/:key` | Read a value |
| `PUT` | `/api/v1/storage/:key` | Write a value (JSON body) |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/storage/:key` | Delete a key |

Scoped per-plugin via auth token. 256 KB per value, 1000 keys per plugin.

Both storage tiers are cleaned up when a plugin is uninstalled.

## Configurable Update Check Interval

The auto-check frequency for plugin and extension updates is now configurable in Settings > Updates:

- Every 30 minutes (default)
- Hourly, every 6 hours, daily, weekly
- Manual only (disable auto-check)

Changes take effect immediately — the timer restarts without an app restart.

## Storage Management UI

Each plugin's settings card in Settings > Plugins now shows KV storage usage with a "Clear data" button.
