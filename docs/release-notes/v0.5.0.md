- **What's New** — full markdown rendering with scrollable release notes
- **OCI fix** — multi-arch image manifests now pass availability checks

## Registry v2

The registry has been completely overhauled from a monolithic `registry.json` to per-plugin YAML files compiled into `index.json` by CI. Each entry now includes:

- **`image_digest`** — SHA-256 of the Docker image, verified at install time
- **`manifest_sha256`** — hash of the plugin manifest for integrity verification
- **`author_url`**, **`created_at`**, **`license`**, **`homepage`** — rich metadata for detail pages

The publish CLI (`nexus-plugin-cli`) was rewritten to target the v2 format with required digest computation.

## Plugin Detail Pages

Marketplace and extension detail pages now show:

- Author name (linked to profile when `author_url` is available)
- Publish age as relative time ("3d ago", "2mo ago")
- License badge
- Repository link

## Update Checker Improvements

- Digest-aware security flags: `DigestVerified`, `DigestAvailable`, `NoDigest`
- **Downgrade protection** — blocks updates that remove `image_digest` from plugins that previously had one
- Source trust field populated from registry metadata
- Registry URL auto-migration for stale persisted URLs

## What's New Panel

Release notes in the Settings updater now render full GitHub-flavored markdown (headings, lists, code blocks, links, blockquotes) via `marked`. Long changelogs scroll within a `max-h-60` container.

## OCI Multi-Arch Fix

Image availability checks now correctly handle OCI index manifests (multi-platform images) instead of rejecting them as invalid.
