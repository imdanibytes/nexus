- **Built-in Nexus MCP** — 13 host-level management tools injected into the MCP gateway so AI clients can list/start/stop plugins, manage extensions, search the marketplace, and check system status without the UI
- **shadcn/ui migration** — all UI components rebuilt on shadcn/ui primitives (Switch, Badge, Tabs, Tooltip, Collapsible, Dialog) for consistent design and accessibility

## Built-in Nexus MCP

AI clients can now manage Nexus itself through the MCP protocol. 13 tools are injected directly into the MCP tool list under the `nexus.*` namespace:

**Read-only (no approval needed):**
- `nexus.list_plugins` — all installed plugins with status, version, port, dev mode
- `nexus.plugin_logs` — recent container log lines
- `nexus.list_extensions` — all extensions with enabled/running status
- `nexus.search_marketplace` — search plugin and extension registries
- `nexus.get_settings` — app settings (resource quotas, update interval)
- `nexus.get_mcp_settings` — MCP gateway settings (enabled flags, tool states)
- `nexus.docker_status` — Docker engine health check

**Mutating (runtime approval dialog):**
- `nexus.plugin_start` / `plugin_stop` / `plugin_remove` / `plugin_install`
- `nexus.extension_enable` / `extension_disable`

Mutating tools go through the existing approval bridge — the user sees the same runtime approval dialog with full context about what the AI is requesting. Permanent approvals persist in MCP settings.

All tools appear in the Settings > MCP > Tool Registry and can be individually toggled on/off.

## shadcn/ui Migration

The entire component library has been rebuilt on shadcn/ui primitives. This brings consistent styling, proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and animation support across all interactive elements.

## Settings Redesign

Settings navigation moves from a vertical sidebar to a horizontal tab strip at the top of the content area. This eliminates the awkward double-sidebar layout (app nav + settings nav) and gives content the full width.

## Dev Mode

Locally installed plugins can now be put into dev mode. When enabled, Nexus watches the plugin's source directory and automatically rebuilds the Docker image and restarts the container on file changes. Includes path traversal protection and manifest ID mutation detection.

## Docker Resilience

When Docker Desktop restarts, container IDs change but names persist. Nexus now falls back to name-based container lookup when ID-based lookup fails, preventing plugins from showing as errored after a Docker restart.
