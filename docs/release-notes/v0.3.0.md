## Security Hardening

### Authentication & Rate Limiting

- **Token-based auth** with AWS-style temporary credentials and automatic session expiry
- **Per-plugin rate limiting** at 100 requests/minute by default

### Network Security

- **SSRF protection**: metadata IP blocking, Host API relay prevention, scheme restrictions, IPv6-mapped address detection, and DNS rebinding mitigation
- **Docker image digest verification** at install time

### Permission Security Testing

- Expanded the `permission-tester` MCP tool from 3 to ~45 security tests across 13 categories
- 49 new Rust unit tests for network security functions (110 total)

## Host Extensions (Revamp)

- **Capability enum** for declarative extension capabilities
- **Extension manifests** with per-platform binary entries and Ed25519 signatures
- **Process extensions**: JSON-RPC over stdin/stdout child process adapter
- **Extension loader**: full install/enable/disable/remove lifecycle
- **Binary signature verification** with Ed25519 and trusted key storage
- **Scope enforcement** with runtime approval for new scope values
- **Extensions marketplace tab** with install, enable, and disable UI

## Granular Permission Control

### Deferred Permissions

- **Per-permission toggles** in the install dialog — approve what you're comfortable with now, defer the rest
- Deferred permissions prompt for approval on first use (just-in-time)
- Deny a deferred permission at runtime and it's revoked permanently (until you restore it)

### Three-State Permission Lifecycle

Every permission now has a clear state: **Active**, **Deferred**, or **Revoked**.

- **Active** — granted and enforced, API calls proceed normally
- **Deferred** — skipped at install, triggers an approval dialog on first use
- **Revoked** — denied, API calls return 403 immediately

### Extension Awareness at Install

- Extension permissions grouped by extension in the install dialog
- Missing extensions show an amber warning badge
- Installed extensions show a green checkmark

## OS Notifications

- **Native OS notifications** (via notify-rust) when approval requests arrive and Nexus is not focused
- **Notification settings tab** with enable/disable toggle
- **Soft-revoke**: revoking preserves approved scopes so restoring doesn't require re-approving each one

## Release Infrastructure

- Linux (ubuntu-22.04) and Windows (windows-latest) added to the build matrix
- Extracted reusable `_build-app.yml` and `_build-sdk.yml` workflows
- Composable release pipeline with dry-run support
- Apple code signing and notarization
- Release notes pipeline: `docs/release-notes/` → `latest.json` → in-app "What's New"

## Housekeeping

- Reorganized project structure: `src-mcp/` → `crates/mcp-sidecar/`, `plugins/` → `examples/plugins/`, `test-extensions/` → `examples/extensions/`
- Added `justfile` with build recipes for all components
- Fixed ESLint config to ignore Tauri build artifacts and generated SDK code
- Fixed bundle identifier (`com.nexus-dashboard.app` → `com.nexus-dashboard.desktop`)
- Test coverage reporting in CI (informational, non-blocking)
